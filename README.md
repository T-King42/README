# My name is Ty. Welcome To my GitHub!
I starting writing code back in 2017 as a self taught programmer, I learned a lot back then using resources like YouTube, books, and online courses, but it seemed like there was always so much more that I needed to know to achieve my goals. I picked up many languages including C#, Python, C++, Kotlin, PHP, and more, and with each new language came with its own new challenges. No matter how much I picked up, I always felt that what I was learning through the self-taught method was a little short of a full-stack so to speak. What I needed was a heading. A gentle push in the right direction. Now with reignited passion and a little help from Coding Dojo, I am back on track and learning more than ever. 

## It may seem empty now, but it is expanding all the time.
I hadn't used git or github much in the past. My small scale projects never seemed to have much use for version control, but that is all changing. With my new skills, I am always on the lookout for new projects and contributions!

## Follow me on my journey!
Writing code can seem like a long and sometimes lonely road to mastery. Being someone that had struggled on my own for a long time, I am committed to documenting my growth here. Maybe one day this repo could help someone out who is in the same place I was, or maybe one day I can look back on this with a mixture of cringe and pride for just how far I've come.
